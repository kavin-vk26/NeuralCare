# 🧠 NeuralCare – Intelligent AI-Powered Health Diagnosis Platform  
*A smart healthcare assistant integrating symptom and weather-based disease prediction*

---

## 📌 Overview  
**NeuralCare** is an AI-driven health triage system designed to provide intelligent, preliminary medical insights based on user-reported symptoms and real-time weather conditions.  
The platform leverages trained machine learning models to assess likely diseases, considering both individual health indicators and environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and air quality.  
It serves as an early-level diagnostic tool, especially beneficial in regions where immediate access to doctors is limited.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Accurately predict probable diseases based on user symptoms and environmental context  
- Design a scalable backend architecture for ML model integration  
- Provide an intuitive, user-friendly interface for non-technical users  
- Enhance health predictions with weather-aware intelligence

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🧠 **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction**: Users can enter multiple symptoms and get AI-driven diagnosis suggestions.  
- ☀️ **Weather-Aware ML Predictions**: The system integrates local weather data (like humidity and temperature) to increase diagnostic accuracy for conditions influenced by climate (e.g., Dengue, Asthma).  
- 🧾 **Modular Backend Planning**: A structured design proposed for future RESTful API integration.  
- 📊 **ML Model Evaluation**: The model is rigorously trained and evaluated using multiple datasets and classification algorithms.  
- 📱 **User-Friendly Frontend**: Team members contributed a responsive UI to support public use.  
- 🌍 **Community Impact**: Designed for underserved communities lacking access to timely healthcare.

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution (Kavin V.K.)

### 🔧 ML Model Training and Development
- Trained machine learning models using datasets containing symptoms and known diseases.  
- Engineered input features to include environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.  
- Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and encoding techniques using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.  
- Implemented classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression.  
- Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.  

### 🌤️ Weather-Based Prediction Logic
- Designed and developed an intelligent weather-disease correlation logic to enhance diagnostic accuracy.  
- Mapped weather-sensitive diseases (e.g., flu, malaria, heatstroke, asthma) to corresponding climate features.  
- Simulated dynamic input from real-world APIs (OpenWeatherMap structure considered) for temperature and humidity readings.  

### 🛠️ Backend Architecture Design 
- Collaborated with the backend implementer, reviewed logic flow, and tested output consistency.  

### 📘 Documentation and Collaboration
- Authored the ML pipeline documentation and data flow diagrams for handoff and reproducibility.  
- Supported the frontend team with the expected input format, and communicated backend data expectations.
